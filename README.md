You're trapped inside your mind (psychological - OCD, guilt, mind block, trapped in past, memory loss, self-victimization (selective memory loss), depression???)
Sound trap..???
Trapped in a loop

Script: They don’t know that they are trapped nor the players. A person is trapped in their mind. We can show the fragments of memory/hint that they are trapped in mind through artifacts/momentos
The person travels through memories, slowly encountering the victim more and more. They do this until they realize they were the killer. They then kill themself, and it is revealed they were in a coma
Stabbing the killer (can’t see any features) repeats the loop
Find a hint through each kill, subtle changes in scenery/objects
Shoot yourself in head (coward move) reveals the ending & ends the loop
Dialogue changes to hint character is becoming more psychotic
We can also make several sus people that makes the player think it’s them and try stabbing them to reach the ending (still repeats loop)


Character(s): 
Main character - psychological problem (memory loss & coma after a car crass)
So the person(X) murdered (Y) in the past but X forgot everything (changed his memories) and went into a coma after a huge accident (remembers it as he got in an accident while the killing happens instead of after). While in the coma, X meets Y. Y dies from the murderer like what happened in real life. Loops. X realizes that they are in a loop and tries to prevent Y’s death by killing the killer. Whenever X kills the wrong person, the story loops. At last, X realizes that X is the killer and stabs oneself, waking up from the coma. 
Suspects are ones near the scene of crime and may have a kill motive
The features of people are unrecognizable until the very last killing which reveals that X is the killer
Memories are picture frames that zoom in to fill the screen
Repeated each time and slightly different every time (extremely subtle in the beginning, ramping up towards the end)
During the killing scene, just the silhouette is shown
Victim (Y) - 6yr old girl
Scene of murder (?) is shown zoomed out, shows victim (not recognizable from the distance)
Eventually reveals victim and makes mc remember who they are– the killer ahh
Suspect 1: parent - single mom(30 F)
Suspect 2: shopkeeper(55 M) of the neighborhood near park - child trafficking 
Suspect 3: person walking at the park(25 M)??-- ankle tracker??? - mark of a past criminal

Murder scene: 
Depressed/suicidal
It was an accident in an almost empty park. Open carry, y takes x’s gun and x accidentally shoots y while trying to get the gun back. 
Gun is added in the last loop
Has a hat on (hides hair)

Level design: 
Setting: park, not many people there, where Y is murdered. 
Color theme: can change normal to creepy 
Time limit to kill the correct killer. If they don’t kill anyone, bad ending. 
Characters at least 3 suspects, X, Y
Main menu: resume, start new game, artifacts(?),  exit
Levels correspond to each suspects; 1 subject, 1 level/loop
Endings: 
Best: shoot yourself  - wakes up from coma (mom of victim forgives them)
Bad: give up he doesn’t wake up(prompt for give up? After each failed-to-kill-correct-killer loop aka victim dies)
Change font for “give up” to be more creepy after each prompt
They die forever
After the 1st successful kill, if the player doesn’t kill anyone before the time limit, add the option to give up
